/**
 * Reads bits-at-a-time where the number of bits is between 1 and 32.
 * Updated for version 2.0 to extend java.io.InputStream. This class
 * can be used together with <code>BitOutputStream</code> to facilitate
 * reading and writing data several bits-at-a-time. BitInputStream objects
 * that are constructed from a File support <code>reset()</code>. However,
 * if constructed from an <code>InputStream</code> an object cannot be reset.
 * <P>
 * Any exceptions generated are rethrown as <code>RuntimeException</code> objects
 * so client code does not have to catch or rethrow them. (Unless the extension
 * of <code>InputStream</code> requires throwing as another type of exception, e.g.,
 * as with method <code>read</code>.
